openPOWERLINK Porting Guide {#page_porting-guide}
===========================

In generally the platform dependencies within the openPOWERLINK stack are
realized via build configurations (as described in [Building openPOWERLINK](\ref _page_build) and [Supported Processor Platforms](\ref_page_platforms)).
These configurations specify specific implementations of general Header files,
which contain the platform specific implementations.
